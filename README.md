Audiophiles' Music Manager is a Python3 application which tries to overcome the
shortcomings of most music management programs out there.

This project is in it's infancy and I use this as a study project so don't
expect anything usable for a long time.

Please give me feedback/suggestions and tips I'm very rusty in coding (it's
been almost 12 years) and this is my first attempt at python.

Please read the Wiki for more info.
